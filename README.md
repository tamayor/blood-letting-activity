The first time I donated blood, I felt a sense of curiosity about the experience. 
It's quite a unique feeling, knowing that your blood is leaving your body. 
While the registered medical technologist (RMT) was drawing my blood, 
I found myself contemplating the idea of creating a website.
I'm currently studying how to design very simple websites, so I thought, 
"What if I create a website dedicated to sharing valuable information about what to do before, during, and after the donation process?"

You can see how blood donation could help you as a person in my case it gave me the reason
just a little bit's enough
Just a second, 
we're not broken, 
just bent and we can learn to love again
